Style the existing navbar so that it is always visible and sticks to the top of the browser when scrolling through the website.
Relatively position the image inside the header element so that it overlaps the boundaries of the header element and overflows slightly into the main content section of the website.
Style the back to top button element so that it is always displayed on the bottom-right hand side of the page, and does not move even if you scroll. Ensure that the button is 80px away from the right side of the page, and 80px away from bottom of the page.
